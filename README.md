🛠️ Project Title: Personal Portfolio Website
 💡 Description:
 In this task, I created a responsive and user-friendly personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. It showcases sections like About Me, Projects, Contact Info, and Resume. This project helped me understand how to structure webpages and style them for a better user experience.
